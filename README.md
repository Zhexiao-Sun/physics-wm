[**TL;DR**] PIWM is a lightweight, physics‚Äëinformed generative model that predicts future images from the current image and actions ‚Äî enabling forecasting with strong existential and temporal consistency in dynamic environments.

The following implementation is based on [DIAMOND](https://github.com/eloialonso/diamond/tree/csgo?tab=readme-ov-file).

## TODO &#128203;<a name="todo"></a>
- [ ] One-page-paper upload (to be done before `[2025/10/30]`)
- [ ] What-is-it video create (to be done before `[2025/10/15]`)
- [x] Dataset release
- [x] Code release
- [x] Preprint release

## Installation
- Quick start with [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TUM-AVS/physics-wm.git
    cd physics-wm
    conda create -n PIWM python=3.10
    conda activate PIWM
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- To quickly play with our trained physics‚Äëinformed BEV world model (PIWM): the first run will automatically download the pretrained model and several spawn points from the [HuggingFace Hub ü§ó](https://huggingface.co/TUM/PIWM_ckpt/tree/main). Please reserve ~1.55GB of disk space. 

    ```bash
    python src/play.py
    ```

When the download completes, press Enter to start. Use WASD and Space to control.

- The default fast config runs best on a CUDA GPU (>12 FPS on an RTX 4080 laptop). The model also runs faster if compiled (>21 FPS on an RTX 4080 Laptop).

    ```bash
    python src/play.py --compile
    ```

All demo videos and performance measurements use the [`fast`](config/world_model_env/fast.yaml) config referenced by the [`trainer`](config/trainer.yaml). You can switch to [`higher_quality`](config/world_model_env/higher_quality.yaml) for improved quality at reduced speed.

## Training

We collected 2,000 episodes in HighwayEnv with an MCTS agent, yielding 2 million BEV frames with aligned states and actions as the training dataset.
We used a random test split of 200 episodes of 1000 steps (specified in `test_split.txt`), and the remaining 1,800 episodes for training.

To get the data ready for training on your machine:
- **Step 1**: Download the preprocessed dataset from the [HuggingFace Hub ü§ó](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dingrui17/highwayEnv_wm/blob/main/highway_dataset_processed.zip) and unzip it (~550GB disk space).

     Dataset structure:
     ```bash
     your_path/highway_dataset_processed
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ full_res
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ low_res
    ```

- **Step 2**: Then edit [config/env/piwm.yaml](config/env/piwm.yaml) and set:

        `path_data_low_res` to `<your_path>/highway_dataset_processed/low_res`
        `path_data_full_res` to `<your_path>/highway_dataset_processed/full_res`

Then you can launch a training run with

```bash
python src/main.py
```
The provided configuration took around 18 hours on an RTX 4090.


## Advanced

- Adjust Soft Mask related weights used during training and inference in [`piwm.yaml`](config/agent/piwm.yaml).

    Our released model uses:
    - Training:
        ```yaml
        mask_gain_train: 1.0
        
        mask_gain_infer: 0.45       # not used in training
        mask_w_blue: 1.0 
        mask_w_green: 0.8 
        ```
    - Inference:
        ```yaml
        mask_gain_train: 1.0        # not used in inference

        mask_gain_infer: 0.45
        mask_w_blue: 0.55  
        mask_w_green: 0.45        
        ```

- Enable zero-shot Warm Start to inject contextual information at inference time and improve stability for smaller models:

    ```bash
    python src/play.py --warmstart
    ```
